Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Physics Department at Stanford University, with degree conferral expected in Summer 2025.
My recent academic work has focused on applying deep learning architectures to data analysis for neutrino experiments.

This blog, however, is a more personal space--a place for me to explore and share ideas across a broad range of interests: mathematics, philosophy, literature, cinema, and more. It has been a while since I wrote anything outside of academic writing, so I'm hoping to reclaim and sharpen my writing skills as I continue to post here.
